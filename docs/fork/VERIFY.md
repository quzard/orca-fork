# Linux verification

Node 24 is required. `package.json` sets `"engines": { "node": "24" }`. Node 22.14 cannot import the `.ts` build plugins (`ERR_UNKNOWN_FILE_EXTENSION`), and `pnpm lint` / `pnpm test` / `pnpm build` must run on Node 24. Bun 1.4.4 (`config/.bun-version`) is what `pnpm test` uses to launch Vitest.

Run this on a Linux checkout of `develop` before treating a hook change as behavior-neutral. The scripts stay on this branch.

```bash
bash fork/scripts/verify/run-linux-verify.sh
```

It refreshes `upstream/main` (`fork/scripts/verify/fetch-upstream-main.sh`), runs `check-no-internal-refs.sh`, then takes the Electron screenshot below under `xvfb-run`. Without `xvfb-run` it writes `screenshot-skipped.txt` and exits 1. Outputs go to `$OUT_DIR` (default `/tmp/orca-fork-verify`).

The checks that gate a push and the daily merge:

```bash
python3 fork/scripts/generate-audit.py --check
node config/scripts/run-vitest.mjs run --config config/vitest.config.ts --maxWorkers=2 src/fork src/shared/fork-hooks
```

`fork/push_github.sh` runs both before it pushes; the daily job's full list is in [DAILY.md](./DAILY.md). After a hook change also run `pnpm tc`, `pnpm exec oxlint <changed files>`, the upstream tests next to each upstream file the change touched, and `pnpm check:max-lines-ratchet` when the change added a `max-lines` first line and its entry in the fork block at the end of `config/max-lines-baseline.txt` (the rules are in FORK-CHANGES.md, 上游文件规则). `pnpm lint` on the fork is expected to fail only where upstream `main` itself fails. Run them with `ORCA_BACKGROUND_LAUNCH=1`.

## Internal identifiers

`check-no-internal-refs.sh` scans `src/fork`, `src/shared/fork-hooks`, `docs/fork`, `fork/` (scripts and the push script), `FORK-CHANGES.md`, and every file added since the upstream base recorded in `src/fork/skills-source-commit.ts`, of any type. Without that commit it falls back to `*.fork.test.ts(x)` and `*-fork.test.ts(x)`. It fails when a pattern matches. Put one fixed string per line in `fork/scripts/verify/internal-ref-patterns.local` (gitignored) or in `ORCA_INTERNAL_REF_PATTERNS` (newline-separated). When neither is set, the script exits 2 without scanning. It does not scan itself. Files copied or renamed from upstream files count as added (`--no-renames`). After the content scan it runs `check-commit-identity.sh` on `ORCA_IDENTITY_REF` (default `HEAD`), which fails unless every commit after `upstream/main` and the floor fixed in the script (`8fd7c96acc`, not read from any file) is authored and committed by `quzard <30899719+quzard@users.noreply.github.com>`, and fails when `upstream/main` is missing. `run-linux-verify.sh` runs this check first, after `fetch-upstream-main.sh` refreshes `upstream/main`.

## What the scripts check

`screenshot-electron.mjs` builds `electron-vite build --mode e2e` when `out/main/index.js` is missing (or when `ORCA_FORK_VERIFY_REBUILD=1`, unless `ORCA_FORK_VERIFY_SKIP_BUILD=1` and `out/` exists), then launches Electron under Xvfb with `ORCA_BACKGROUND_LAUNCH=1` and `ORCA_E2E_HEADLESS=1`. It uses an isolated `HOME` and `ORCA_E2E_USER_DATA_DIR`, waits for the first window, and writes `fork-base-window.png` and `fork-base-window.txt` (title and URL). The window stays hidden.

## Checks only a Mac can do

These need macOS, a logged-in GUI session, or a Mac-only binary. Linux does not run them.

- Code signing with the local `Orca Local Signing` identity, and the signed-app install/rollback in the Mac install script (F002).
- macOS keychain prompts versus the file secret store, including a packaged app that must not call Safe Storage (F038). The file backend is registered for packaged macOS; Linux cannot prove the zero Safe Storage count.
- `electron-builder --mac dmg:arm64 zip:arm64` through `fork/scripts/install-mac-release.sh`, `mac.signIgnore`, and the Docker manylinux orcad slots (F002, F036). The installer refuses a non-arm64 Node. On Linux the fork tests run `bash -n` on that script and on `fork/scripts/build-orcad-linux-prebuilds.sh`, check `assertLocalTemplateTargets` against a manifest without the glibc 2.17 slot, and, when `out/cli/index.js` exists (after `pnpm build:cli`), run `node fork/scripts/verify-packaged-cli-closure.mjs`. A checkout without a Docker daemon does not compile the manylinux slots. The x64 PTY check is not executed because that package is not built.
- Dragging the computer-use app card into System Settings (`pnpm build:computer-macos`, F006). Linux only checks, in `src/fork/computer-use/permission-card.fork.test.ts`, that `ForkPermissionCard.swift` uses the same `--fork-drag-card` argument and that `main.swift` installs the card.
- Opening an SSH workspace, or a managed-server workspace whose files are on that SSH host, in Cursor, VS Code, or Zed. That is upstream #33877 (`cursor --new-window --remote ssh-remote+…`, not a `cursor://` URL) and needs the editor plus a reachable SSH host. The per-port Forward button on a managed workspace (F043) needs that host too.
- Seeing a host file from a terminal or chat link on a managed server (F046): a file outside every workspace, a file another workspace holds, and HTML in the doc preview. Linux covers the preview plan, the grant location, the host's absolute-path reads (fonts, ranged reads past 512 KiB, dot-named files and links to them refused), the main-process read with its fallback to host grants (including a symlink to `~/.ssh/id_rsa` that stays unreadable), which folders open without a prompt, the kept read-only view and the loader with `host-file-doc-preview*.fork.test.*` and `kept-host-file-view*.fork.test.tsx`. `tests/e2e/fork-f046-host-file-links.spec.ts` drives the same links against an x86_64 Docker host. The rendered page needs that server; see the manual list below.
- A signed Mac app. The deep link and the permission card are not a substitute for that check.

## Manual checks with a Linux host

Install this build on the Mac and connect an x86_64 Linux host over SSH; let the app deploy or update the host's managed server (orcad) to the same build.

### F046 host file links

An older fork orcad does not grant paths outside the workspace without `crossWorkspace`: HTML outside every workspace 404s and another workspace's file switches workspaces. A host without `files.hostDocPreview.*` (a fork orcad from before it, or upstream `orca serve`) reads such a page file by file through terminal grants: text stops at 512 KiB and fonts fail. Those are the expected degradations. On the host, create workspaces A (`~/wt/app`) and B (`~/wt/lib`), and outside them `~/notes/plain.txt`, `~/notes/doc.md` (with `![](img/chart.png)`) and `~/notes/img/chart.png`, `~/pages/report.html` (styles inline), `~/pages/site.html` (linking `style.css`, `img/a.png`, a script over 512 KiB and a web font) and those files, `~/pages/.env`, `~/pages/leak.css` (a symlink to `~/.ssh/id_rsa` or another file outside the folder), `~/pages/huge.html` (over 512 KiB), `~/top.html` (linking `~/top.css`), and `/tmp/same.txt` (different content on the Mac and on the host).

1. Print the absolute path of `~/notes/plain.txt` in A's terminal and Cmd-click it: A's editor opens the host's content, A stays active, and the file saves (newer hosts grant write).
2. `/tmp/same.txt` shows the host's content, not the Mac's.
3. After `cd ~/notes && ls`, click `plain.txt` (relative to the cwd), and an OSC 8 link (`printf '\e]8;;file:///home/<u>/notes/plain.txt\e\\link\e]8;;\e\\\n'`): same as 1. Note whether a bare `~/notes/plain.txt` becomes a link and opens the host file (upstream behavior).
4. `doc.md` opens in the editor; its Markdown preview renders and shows `img/chart.png`.
5. `report.html` opens a doc preview tab in A that renders the page: no editor source, no system browser, no workspace switch.
6. `site.html` loads its CSS, image, script and font with no folder prompt. `leak.css` and `.env` are among the failed resources and the page gets none of their content.
7. `huge.html` renders.
8. `~/top.html` sits directly in the home folder: the folder prompt names `~`; after allowing it the CSS loads.
9. In A's terminal, click a text file of B (`~/wt/lib/src/index.ts`): it opens read-only in A and B does not activate. After an app restart the tab is still in A and readable.
10. From A, click an HTML file of B: a doc preview opens in A, B does not activate, and the files beside it load without a folder prompt.
11. Click B's root directory: B activates (upstream behavior).
12. The same absolute-path links in A's native agent chat behave like 1, 4, 5 and 9.
13. Paste the absolute path of `~/pages/report.html`, or `file:///home/<u>/pages/report.html`, into the address bar of a browser page in A: it becomes a doc preview read from the host.
14. Click `~/notes` (a folder): the hint names a folder outside the host's workspaces and nothing on the Mac opens. Click a missing `~/nope.txt`: the hint says the host has no such file.
15. Restart the app with the `report.html` preview open: it reads from the host again.
16. In a local Mac workspace, local HTML follows the link-routing setting (system browser or in-app page), and a file of another local workspace still switches to it (upstream behavior).
17. With a paired client or phone, if available: files outside every workspace open (upstream #33958).

### F047 workspace repositories

Use a requirement directory that is itself a git repository and holds `frontend/` (a plain clone), `backend/` (from `git worktree add`), `.cache/` (with a `.git`, skipped), `node_modules/pkg/` (skipped), `linked/` (a directory symlink to a repository elsewhere, skipped), and a submodule registered in the root `.gitmodules` but not initialized. Run the list locally first, then with the same layout on the Linux host.

1. Source control, Workspace repos: the root is first; changed or ahead repositories come next, expanded; clean ones are collapsed; Other is last and collapsed, holding the uninitialized submodule. Headers show the branch, `N changed` and `X ahead, Y behind`.
2. Click an unstaged file in `backend`: the diff is `backend`'s own, not the root's whole-file addition.
3. `git mv a.ts b.ts` in `frontend`: it is under Staged and opens as a rename diff (old content on the left).
4. Make a merge conflict in `frontend`: the conflicted file opens as a plain diff and the tab survives the next poll; the root's Current repo panel shows no conflict banner.
5. Expand `backend`, set the compare target to `origin/develop` and click Use: ahead/behind updates within seconds and survives an Orca restart. `origin/nope` shows `Branch compare unavailable: …` in that group. `-x` shows `Couldn't save the compare target: …` under the input and keeps the draft. Clear returns to the default (`origin/HEAD`).
6. Corrupt `frontend/.git/index`: that group moves up, expands and shows `Couldn't read status: …`; Only show changed does not hide it. Repairing the index restores it.
7. Minimize the window with the panel open: no git processes start every few seconds; restoring the window refreshes once.
8. Workspace A on Workspace repos, B on Current repo: switching keeps each choice with no flash of the other view.
9. Open a diff tab of a nested repository's file, close source control, wait over a minute (or restart): the tab still shows that repository's diff.
10. On the Linux host (orcad deployed by this build), the switch enables after the probe, and the list, status, diffs and compare target come from the host.
11. Drop the network or the SSH connection with that panel open: `Can't reach the host to check workspace repos.`; after reconnecting, the switch comes back within about 15 seconds without switching workspaces.
12. A host with an older orcad that lacks the capability: the switch is disabled with `Update the host to compare nested repositories` and no new method is sent.
13. An `ssh:` row that orcad does not serve yet: the switch is disabled with the reconnect hint.
